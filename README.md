# Reference Discord.py Bot






This descriptive document for discord.py is not intended to be used for a bot,
All this is for, is to help you have a more deap understanding on what each of these do!
Using this as a default discord bot, is not only slow, but messy.. your code should be organized neatly.
This is just for deap learning experience, I recomend to not copy my code and use it for your self.
Learn from my code and make it by your self alone.. You can always reference it!



This reference page file, is to help make younge new coders a more understanding as my self when I started out!
